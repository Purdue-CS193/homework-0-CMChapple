# Cici's First CS193 Homework

## Some things I like about about CS193

- It breaks down some of the barriers into the CS industry by helping people new to the industry get used to standard software
- The magic words are pretty neat. I like waffles.
- It is listed as a required class even if you have experience in the softwares
